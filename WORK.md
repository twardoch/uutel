# UUTEL Work Progress

## Current Iteration Items

Based on PLAN.md and TODO.md analysis, prioritizing Phase 1 implementation:

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Create core infrastructure** - Set up BaseUU class and common interfaces
2. **Implement authentication framework** - Base auth classes and utilities
3. **Set up project structure** - Core and providers directories following UU naming convention
4. **Start with simplest provider** - Begin with basic provider implementation
5. **Write tests first** - TDD approach for all components

### Current State Analysis:
- ✅ Basic package structure exists with src/uutel/
- ✅ Tests are running (1 test passing)
- ✅ PLAN.md and TODO.md provide clear roadmap
- ❌ Missing core/ directory structure
- ❌ Missing providers/ directory structure
- ❌ Missing BaseUU implementation
- ❌ Missing authentication framework

### Package Dependencies to Add:
From PLAN.md requirements:
- litellm >= 1.70.0 (core requirement)
- httpx >= 0.25.0 (HTTP client)
- pydantic >= 2.0.0 (data validation)
- google-auth >= 2.15.0 (for Cloud providers)

### Next Steps:
1. Create core/base.py with BaseUU class extending LiteLLM's BaseLLM
2. Set up proper directory structure per PLAN.md specifications
3. Add required dependencies via uv add
4. Write tests for base functionality
5. Implement first provider (likely simplest one)

### Testing Strategy:
- Write failing test first (RED)
- Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
- Refactor while keeping tests green
- Repeat for each component

## Work Log:
- [2025-09-29] Initial analysis complete, starting core infrastructure implementation
- [2025-09-29] ✅ Core infrastructure complete:
  - BaseUU class extending LiteLLM's CustomLLM
  - Authentication framework with BaseAuth and AuthResult
  - Core utilities (message transformation, HTTP client, validation)
  - All tests passing (24/24)
  - Main package exports working
- [2025-09-29] Next: Implement first provider (simplest one to validate architecture)
- [2025-09-29] ✅ Quality improvements complete:
  - Exception framework: 7 exception types, 16 tests, 100% coverage
  - Pytest configuration: Rich fixtures and utilities for comprehensive testing
  - Basic usage example: Demonstrates all core UUTEL functionality
  - Test coverage: 71% → 84% overall, utils.py 79% → 98%
  - Total tests: 40 → 55 tests, all passing
- [2025-09-29] Ready for Phase 2: Provider implementations with robust foundation
