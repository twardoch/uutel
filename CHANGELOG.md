All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-30

### Added - Real Provider Implementations (#201)
Replaced all mock provider implementations with real integrations:

#### 1. **Codex Provider** (ChatGPT CLI Integration)
- **Authentication**: Reads from `~/.codex/auth.json` (requires `codex login` CLI)
- **API Integration**: Connects to ChatGPT backend at `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`
- **Request Format**: Uses Codex-specific `input` field instead of OpenAI's `messages`
- **Headers**: Includes account-id, version, originator headers per Codex protocol
- **Fallback**: Falls back to OpenAI API when `api_key` is provided
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP error handling with user-friendly messages

#### 2. **Claude Code Provider** (Anthropic CLI Integration)
- **CLI Integration**: Executes `claude-code` CLI via subprocess
- **Authentication**: Uses Claude Code's built-in auth system
- **Installation**: Requires `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Models**: Supports sonnet, opus, claude-sonnet-4, claude-opus-4
- **Timeout**: 120-second timeout for CLI operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing CLI or auth failures

#### 3. **Gemini CLI Provider** (Google Gemini Integration)
- **Dual Mode**: API key or CLI-based authentication
- **API Mode**: Direct API calls to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
  - Uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` env vars
  - Proper Gemini API message format conversion
- **CLI Mode**: Falls back to `gemini` CLI tool
  - Requires `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- **Models**: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-pro, gemini-flash
- **Smart Fallback**: Tries API key first, then CLI if available

#### 4. **Cloud Code AI Provider** (Google OAuth Integration)
- **OAuth Support**: Reads credentials from `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`
- **API Key Support**: Also supports `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Multiple Credential Locations**: Checks `.gemini`, `.config/gemini`, `.google-cloud-code`
- **Same Models**: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-pro, gemini-flash
- **Usage Metadata**: Includes token usage information in responses
- **Endpoints**: Uses `/v1internal:generateContent` and streaming SSE to deliver real completions with tool + JSON schema support

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Reference Analysis**: Analyzed TypeScript/JavaScript reference implementations:
  - `codex-ai-provider` (Vercel AI SDK)
  - `ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli` (Gemini CLI Core)
  - `cloud-code-ai-provider` (Google Cloud Code)
  - `ai-sdk-provider-claude-code` (Anthropic SDK)
- **Architecture Adaptation**: Converted Node.js patterns to Python/LiteLLM architecture
- **Authentication Flows**: Integrated with CLI authentication systems and OAuth
- **HTTP Client**: Uses `httpx` for reliable HTTP/2 connections
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages guiding users to authentication setup

### Authentication Setup Required

**Codex**: `codex login` (creates `~/.codex/auth.json`)
**Claude Code**: Install CLI + authenticate
**Gemini CLI**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or run `gemini login`
**Cloud Code**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or run `gemini login` (creates OAuth creds)

### Enhanced - Gemini CLI Provider (2025-09-30)
- Added google-generativeai powered completion path with tool/function mapping and JSON schema shaping.
- Implemented streaming adapter with chunked responses plus CLI credential refresh fallback.
- Normalised multimodal message conversion (text + base64 imagery) for LiteLLM compatibility.

### Enhanced - Claude Code Provider (2025-10-01)
- Replaced placeholder implementation with CLI subprocess integration using structured environment payloads and shared runner utilities.
- Added streaming JSONL parser emitting text/tool chunks, optional cancellation guard via threading event, and timeout propagation.
- Normalised usage metadata mapping and improved error messages when the CLI binary is missing.
- Introduced dedicated tests in `tests/test_claude_provider.py` covering completion, streaming, cancellation, and CLI absence scenarios.

### Documentation & Examples (2025-10-01)
- CLI `list_engines` now surfaces provider-specific credential requirements.
- `examples/basic_usage.py` replays the deterministic Claude fixture and prints commands required for live CLAUDE runs.
- README examples section points to the fixture replay and enumerates the installation/login steps for enabling live Claude streaming.

### Testing
- ✅ 2025-09-30: `uvx hatch test` (221 passed, 4 xfailed placeholders) after Gemini provider integration
- ✅ 2025-09-30: /report verification — `uvx hatch test` (221 passed, 4 xfailed placeholders)
- ✅ 2025-09-30: `tests/test_cloud_code_provider.py` (4 passed) and `tests/test_provider_fixtures.py` (4 passed) after Cloud Code provider upgrade
- ✅ 2025-09-30: `uvx hatch test` (225 passed, 2 xfailed placeholders) with Cloud Code provider hitting `/v1internal`
- ✅ 2025-09-30: /report verification — `uvx hatch test` (225 passed, 2 xfailed placeholders)
- ✅ 2025-09-30: /report verification — `uvx hatch test` (217 passed, 6 xfailed placeholders)
- ✅ All 4 providers load successfully
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing authentication
- ✅ Clear user guidance for setup requirements
- ⚠️ Full integration tests require actual CLI authentication
- ⚠️ `uvx hatch test` has unrelated ImportErrors in test suite
- ❌ 2025-09-30: `uvx hatch test` (8 failures) — CLI messaging assertions still expect legacy phrasing
- ✅ 2025-09-30: `uvx hatch test` (217 passed, 6 xfailed placeholders) during /report verification
- ✅ 2025-09-30: `uvx hatch test tests/test_provider_fixtures.py`, `tests/test_runners.py`, `tests/test_auth.py`, `tests/test_codex_provider.py` (all new suites passing)
- ✅ 2025-10-01: `uvx hatch test` (229 passed) after Claude Code provider/CLI/doc refresh

### Added - Streaming & Auth Infrastructure (2025-09-30)
- Captured Gemini, Cloud Code, and Codex sample outputs and enforced their presence via `tests/test_provider_fixtures.py`.
- Implemented shared subprocess runner with sync/async streaming helpers plus coverage in `tests/test_runners.py`.
- Extended authentication helpers to load CLI/OAuth credentials with refresh support and new tests in `tests/test_auth.py`.
- Replaced Codex streaming mocks with SSE parsing that yields `GenericStreamingChunk` data, and normalised Codex tool/function call payloads with expanded `tests/test_codex_provider.py`.
- ⚪ 2025-09-30: Added pytest xfail placeholders for Claude/Gemini/Cloud Code providers (`tests/test_provider_placeholders.py`) to track missing real integrations

### Fixed - Core Utility Surface (#202)
- Restored `RetryConfig`, HTTP client factory, tool schema validators/transformers, and tool call extraction helpers so the test suite and downstream imports match the planned API surface.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` *(fails: CLI + provider suites still rely on mock integrations hitting live endpoints)*, `uvx hatch test tests/test_utils.py tests/test_tool_calling.py` *(pass: 57 utility/tests)*

### Changed - Codex Completion Workflow (#202)
- Refactored `CodexUU` to build real OpenAI/Codex payloads, honour injected HTTP clients, normalise assistant content, and reuse shared retrying client infrastructure; updated tests to stub HTTP calls and validate request construction.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_utils.py tests/test_tool_calling.py tests/test_codex_provider.py` *(pass: 71 utility + Codex tests)*; full `uvx hatch test` still fails on legacy CLI messaging expectations pending fixture refresh.

### Fixed - CLI Error Messaging Fixtures
- Updated CLI tests to expect contextual `format_error_message` output and refreshed engine listing assertions to match current UX copy.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` *(pass: 199 tests)*.

### Documentation - Provider Authentication Prerequisites
- Added provider-specific installation and credential setup guidance to `README.md` (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cloud Code).
- Drafted the same guidance in `WORK.md` for traceability.
