## Package Selection Rationale

### Why These Specific Versions?
- **Minimum versions**: Chosen to ensure compatibility with older Python installations
- **Modern libraries**: Selected for better type hints, async support, and performance
- **Stable APIs**: All dependencies have stable, well-documented APIs
- **Active maintenance**: All packages are actively maintained with regular updates

### Alternative Considerations
- **requests vs httpx**: httpx chosen for async support and modern Python compatibility
- **argparse vs typer**: typer chosen for better type hints and automatic documentation
- **unittest vs pytest**: pytest chosen for better fixtures and more readable tests
- **black vs ruff**: ruff chosen for speed and comprehensive functionality

## Security Considerations
- All dependencies are from trusted sources (PyPI verified packages)
- Version pinning prevents unexpected updates that could introduce vulnerabilities
- Regular dependency updates planned to address security issues
- No dependencies with known security vulnerabilities

## Future Dependency Plans
- Consider adding `tenacity` for more sophisticated retry logic
- May add `click-completion` for shell completions
- Consider `structlog` for more structured logging
- Evaluate `pydantic-extra-types` for specialized validation types
