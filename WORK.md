- Tests-first: added failing coverage in `tests/test_examples.py` for decode/permission stub errors, live-run propagation, and canonical engine alignment plus `tests/test_config.py` permission warning expectation; observed targeted failures via `uvx hatch test` runs on the new cases.
- Implementation: added logging-aware guards to `examples/basic_usage._load_stub_payload`, imported `_gather_live_runs` in tests, and updated `uutel.core.config.load_config` to emit explicit OSError warnings while returning clean defaults.
- Verification: `uvx hatch test tests/test_examples.py tests/test_config.py` (37 passed, 0 failed) and full `uvx hatch test` (431 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped; 8.66s).

- Wait, but: confirmed `TODO.md` remains empty post-cleanup and noted the need to seed fresh maintenance items before continuing with /work as instructed.
- Planning: researched UTF-8 file handling guidance, then added Phase 33 example fixture safety tasks (stub dir requires directory, stub loader guards directories + enforces UTF-8, recorded playback uses UTF-8) to PLAN.md/TODO.md.
- Immediate focus: draft failing tests covering stub directory misconfiguration, directory-as-stub guard, and explicit UTF-8 reads before patching `examples/basic_usage.py`.
- Tests-first: added `tests/test_examples.py` cases for stub dir file paths, directory impostors, UTF-8 enforcement for stub loads, and recorded fixture playback; all four failed against current implementation (directory raise, missing encoding assertions).

- Tests-first: `uvx hatch test tests/test_fixture_integrity.py::test_validate_completion_fixture_rejects_inconsistent_totals` (failed: validation accepted mismatched totals), `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIConfigCommands::test_config_show_displays_default_booleans` (failed: output printed `None`), `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIDiagnostics::test_check_provider_readiness_gemini_ignores_blank_api_key` and `...cloud_ignores_blank_api_key` (failed: whitespace env vars treated as credentials).
- Implementation: added `_enforce_usage_totals` helper in `src/uutel/core/fixture_validation.py` to raise `ValidationError` when totals drift; updated `_config_show` to render unset booleans as `default (False)`; introduced `_get_env` normaliser in `_check_provider_readiness` to trim env values and reused across Codex/Gemini/Cloud flows.
- Verification: targeted reruns `uvx hatch test` for the four failing cases now passing plus `tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIProviderReadiness::test_check_provider_readiness_codex_ignores_blank_env`; full regression `uvx hatch test` (403 passed, 1 skipped; 8.58s) confirming suite stability.

- Implementation: annotated tests/test_package.py with `this_file` and skipped generated src/uutel/_version.py; reran targeted suite (49 passed, 1 skipped).
- Tests-first: extended Gemini provider suite with `_build_cli_env` coverage (trimmed token + multi-env expectations) - failure confirmed current behaviour only set GOOGLE_API_KEY.
- Implementation: normalised `_build_cli_env` to trim tokens and populate all recognised env vars; targeted tests now pass.
- Tests-first: introduced `tests/test_dependencies_doc.py` validating DEPENDENCIES.md against pyproject (failed due to stale CLI/docs entries).
- Implementation: refreshed DEPENDENCIES.md to emphasise Fire-based CLI, removed isort entry, and reran doc guard (pass).
- Verification: `uvx hatch test` (398 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped; 8.78s) confirming quality guard additions.
- /work: planning Phase 27 recorded example robustness tasks (content normalisation, token fallback, alias validation) with tests-first workflow before implementation.
- Tests-first: `uvx hatch test tests/test_examples.py::test_extract_recorded_text_handles_structured_message_content` (failed; Codex recorded text returned structured list and tokens stayed zero without totals).
- Implementation: added `_normalise_structured_content` and `_sum_positive_tokens` helpers in `examples/basic_usage.py` to flatten structured message content and compute token fallbacks for Codex/Gemini/Cloud Code; expanded tests covering structured content, fallback totals, and alias validation.
- Verification: `uvx hatch test tests/test_examples.py` (8 passed, 0 failed; 6.56s) and full `uvx hatch test` (345 passed, 0 failed; 8.78s) confirming recorded example robustness improvements.

- Implementation: enhanced `CodexUU._parse_retry_after` to trim values, parse RFC 7231 dates via `parsedate_to_datetime`, and ceil positive deltas; added streaming guidance tests asserting retry hints embed parsed seconds.
- Verification: targeted runs `uvx hatch test tests/test_codex_provider.py::TestCodexUUStreaming::test_parse_retry_after_supports_http_date_header` and `...::test_format_status_guidance_includes_seconds_for_http_date` now pass.
- Tests-first: `uvx hatch test tests/test_gemini_provider.py::test_get_api_key_trims_and_prioritises_env_vars` (failed, showing `_get_api_key` preserved whitespace and precedence gaps).
- Implementation: normalised `GeminiCLIUU._get_api_key` to strip whitespace and skip blanks before returning, plus new tests covering precedence and empty env handling.
- Verification: targeted runs `uvx hatch test tests/test_gemini_provider.py::test_get_api_key_trims_and_prioritises_env_vars` and `...::test_get_api_key_returns_none_when_all_blank` now pass.
- Tests-first: `uvx hatch test tests/test_cloud_code_provider.py::test_resolve_project_id_prefers_environment_fallback` (failed thanks to untrimmed env fallback).

- /work setup: drafted failing tests for alias normalisation + extract fallback, prepare updated fixture expectations once new snippets defined.
- Planned verifications: targeted pytest runs for updated suites followed by full `uvx hatch test` before /report.
- Implemented richer provider fixture content and adjusted example snippet assertions to demand realistic text; added regression tests for placeholder-sensitive extraction paths.
- Extended `tests/test_cli_validators.py` to parameterise alias checks for codex/claude/gemini/cloud (including whitespace trimming), keeping validation guidance robust.
- Targeted verification: `uvx hatch test tests/test_examples.py tests/test_cli_validators.py` -> 11 passed (6.64s) confirming new tests and fixtures integrate cleanly.
- Extended Cloud Code regression expectation to match refreshed fixture usage totals and re-ran focused suite (`uvx hatch test tests/test_cloud_code_provider.py` -> 4 passed, 0.06s).

- Placeholder guardrails: extended `_PLACEHOLDER_PHRASES`, tightened fixture/doc scans, and added CLI heuristics tests; `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli.py -k placeholder` -> 3 passed.
- Full regression: `uvx hatch test` (279 passed, 0 failed; 8.21s) confirming new suites integrate cleanly post-doc tweak.
- Wait, but: re-scanned docs for banned phrases (updated TROUBLESHOOTING heading) to avoid false positives before closing iteration.
- /report: revisited PLAN/TODO, reviewed git status, executed `uvx hatch test` (262 passed, 0 failed; 7.6s) and captured the run in CHANGELOG ahead of cleanup.

- /cleanup: ran `make clean` to clear caches, build artefacts, and pytest state after the verification run.
- Planning: drafted Phase 12 in PLAN.md and seeded TODO.md with doc cleanup, CLI guardrail, and fixture integrity tasks.
- Iteration focus: ① update docs, ② harden `uutel test` placeholder detection, ③ add fixture integrity regression.
- Docs: rewrote README quickstart + provider status, refreshed troubleshooting/AGENTS/GEMINI/QWEN/LLXPRT to drop mock verbiage and highlight alias usage.
- CLI: taught `uutel test` to treat placeholder text as failure via `_looks_like_placeholder`, with new unit coverage.
- Tests added: `tests/test_fixture_integrity.py` scanning recorded fixtures/docs for placeholders.
- Tests run: `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli.py::TestUUTELCLI::test_test_command_rejects_placeholder_output`, `uvx hatch test tests/test_fixture_integrity.py`, full `uvx hatch test` (268 passed, 0 failed, 8.5s).

- /report: revisited `PLAN.md`/`TODO.md` (currently placeholder), inspected `git status` for outstanding provider edits, ran `uvx hatch test` (259 passed, 0 failed; 7.7s) and logged the outcome in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- /cleanup: executed `make clean` to drop caches and build artefacts after the regression sweep.
- Observations: TODO list presently empty; need to seed fresh maintenance tasks before continuing with /work as instructed.
- Wait, but: confirmed example replay tests remain deterministic post-clean and noted readiness to draft the next quality-focused TODO batch.
- Iteration focus: (1) Gemini CLI completion JSON parsing, (2) Gemini CLI streaming JSONL decoding, (3) Codex OpenAI fallback payload validation/tests.
- Shipped Gemini CLI completion extraction + streaming JSONL parsing with new unit coverage, and added Codex OpenAI fallback payload/header regression.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` (262 passed, 0 failed) to validate the updated providers and CLI behaviours.

- /report: `uvx hatch test` (248 passed); `CHANGELOG.md` updated with fresh run; cleanup via `make clean`.
- TODO seeded with Phase 11 hardening tasks (live example toggle, diagnostics command, Codex error guidance).
- Immediate focus:
  1. Add `UUTEL_LIVE_EXAMPLE` path to `examples/basic_usage.py` with dual-path tests.
  2. Implement `uutel diagnostics` CLI command leveraging `_check_provider_readiness` guidance.
  3. Broaden Codex error translation for 403/429/5xx across sync/async/streaming with targeted tests.
- TDD plan: write failing tests for each item before implementation; ensure coverage for env toggles, CLI output, and HTTP error handling.
- Post-implementation: rerun `uvx hatch test`, update docs (README/TROUBLESHOOTING/CHANGELOG), mark TODO/PLAN items complete, execute `/report`.
- Added env-gated live mode to `examples/basic_usage.py` with stub directory support and updated messaging.

# 2025-09-30

- /work iteration: targeting Cloud Code provider parity with TS reference (`/v1internal:generateContent` + streaming). Immediate items:
  - Write failing unit tests that exercise Cloud Code completion + streaming using recorded fixtures and tool/JSON schema coverage.
  - Implement Cloud Code request translation, OAuth/API-key auth, and SSE stream parsing with usage metadata mapping.
  - Ensure CLI/docs/TODO updates reflect completed Cloud Code tasks and capture deterministic fixtures for future stability.
  - Added deterministic unit suite `tests/test_cloud_code_provider.py` covering completion auth modes, tool call mapping, and SSE streaming chunks.
  - Replaced `CloudCodeUU` implementation with `/v1internal` request body translation, JSON schema injection, tool declarations, usage propagation, and streaming parser leveraging `create_http_client` utilities.
  - Updated Cloud Code fixture format + TODO/PLAN milestones to reflect delivered functionality.
  - Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_cloud_code_provider.py` (4 passed); `uvx hatch test tests/test_provider_fixtures.py` (4 passed) verifying fixture shape.
  - Tests: `uvx hatch test` (225 passed, 2 xfailed placeholders) confirming suite health post-Cloud Code upgrade.

- Reviewed `llms.txt` snapshot alongside provider modules to confirm current implementations still return mock data and rely on direct network calls without retry/credential hygiene. Logged gaps against Vercel provider references (streaming, auth refresh, tooling still missing).
- Restored core utility surface needed by test suite: reintroduced `RetryConfig`, resilient `create_http_client`, tool schema validators/transformers, and response extraction helpers. Added minimal retry wrappers for sync/async `httpx` clients to unblock provider work.
- Exported the recovered utilities via `uutel.core` and package `__init__` so downstream imports match plan/tests.
- Upgraded `CodexUU` to build real HTTP payloads, honour injected clients, and normalise responses; updated test suite to exercise request construction via stubbed clients instead of relying on in-method mocks.
- Tests:
  - `uvx hatch test` -> fails (8 CLI assertions) because fixtures still expect legacy `❌ Error: …` phrasing while implementation now emits contextual hints (`❌ … in completion`); remaining provider work also pending.
- Immediate focus: draft provider credential prerequisites in this log before updating README; continue planning streaming/tooling work.
- Updated CLI test expectations to match contextual error helper output and refreshed engine listing assertions.
- Tests:
  - `uvx hatch test` -> pass (199 tests) after syncing CLI fixtures with new messaging format.
- /report: `uvx hatch test` (199 passed) confirmed; added `this_file` header to `CHANGELOG.md`, logged test run there, and confirmed no TODO/PLAN items ready for removal.
- /cleanup: executed `make clean` to clear caches (`.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, build artifacts).
- Added pytest `xfail` placeholders for Claude, Gemini CLI, and Cloud Code providers to capture expected completion/streaming behaviour without hitting external CLIs/APIs; monkeypatched credential checks to fail fast offline.
- Tests:
  - `uvx hatch test` -> pass with 199 tests, 6 xfails (new placeholders)

## Provider Credential Prerequisites (draft for README)

- Codex (ChatGPT backend)
  - Install CLI: `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` (provides the `codex` binary).
  - Authenticate: `codex login` creates `~/.codex/auth.json` with `access_token` and `account_id`.
  - Fallback: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to bypass CLI tokens and call standard Chat Completions.
  - Verify: `codex --version` reports the installed release; the CLI auto-refreshes tokens after login.
- Claude Code (Anthropic)
  - Install CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.
  - Authenticate: `claude login` stores credentials under `~/.claude*/` (CLI manages session refresh).
  - Requirements: Node.js ≥18 with the CLI available on `PATH`.
  - Verify: `claude --version` returns the installed release; rerun `claude login` if the CLI prompts for auth.
- Gemini CLI Core (Google)
  - Install CLI: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` (provides the `gemini` binary).
  - Authenticate (option 1): `gemini login` launches OAuth and writes `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`.
  - Authenticate (option 2): set one of `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`.
  - Verify: `gemini models list` should succeed once credentials are valid.
- Google Cloud Code AI
  - Shares Gemini credentials: prefers OAuth tokens from `gemini login`, also accepts the same API key env vars.
  - Looks in `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`, `~/.config/gemini/oauth_creds.json`, or `~/.google-cloud-code/credentials.json`.
  - Verify: ensure `gemini login` has been run for the target Google account or export `GOOGLE_API_KEY` before invoking Cloud Code models.
  - `uvx hatch test tests/test_utils.py tests/test_tool_calling.py tests/test_codex_provider.py` -> pass (71 tests) validating recovered utilities plus the new Codex client workflow.
- /report: reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md, inspected git status, ran `uvx hatch test` (199 passed, 6 xfailed), pruned completed placeholder task from TODO/PLAN, and logged test run in CHANGELOG.
- /cleanup: executed `make clean` to drop caches (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, coverage files, `__pycache__`).
- Next: capture recorded CLI fixtures, implement Codex streaming/tool paths, and expand auth refresh coverage for Google providers.
- Iteration focus: capture Gemini/Cloud Code/Codex sample outputs; design shared subprocess runner with streaming; extend authentication helpers for CLI + OAuth flows.
- Progress: Added provider fixture tests and JSON samples; delivered shared subprocess runner with sync/async streaming helpers; expanded auth loader utilities with refresh support; rewrote Codex streaming to parse SSE into `GenericStreamingChunk` and normalised tool call payloads with new tests.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` (217 passed, 6 xfailed placeholders) plus targeted suites for fixtures, runners, auth, and codex provider.
- /report: reviewed TODO/PLAN, pruned completed entries, ran `uvx hatch test` (217 passed, 6 xfailed placeholders), logged results in CHANGELOG.
- /cleanup: executed `make clean` to clear caches and build artifacts.
- Checked TODO.md — remaining provider tasks pending; proceeding to /work phase to tackle next priority items.
- Iteration TODO: Gemini provider tests, implementation, dependency updates.
- Implemented Gemini provider against google-generativeai with tool/JSON schema support, multimodal message conversion, API/CLI fallback instrumentation.
- Added dedicated Gemini provider tests covering API completions, streaming, CLI fallback refresh, and updated optional dependency for google-generativeai.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 221 passed, 4 xfailed placeholders (CLAUDE/Gemini/Cloud Code pending).
