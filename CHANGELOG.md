# CHANGELOG

### Hardened - Alias Edge-Case Handling (2025-10-07)
- `_normalise_engine_alias` now strips stray punctuation/underscores so aliases like `--codex--` and `__gemini__` resolve to their canonical engines across CLI flows.
- `validate_engine` rejects cross-provider nested shorthands (e.g. `uutel/claude/gemini-2.5-pro`) with descriptive guidance and emits deterministically sorted engine/alias listings for easier support triage.
- CLI integration now accepts punctuated aliases for `uutel complete`/`uutel test`, ensuring end-to-end alias normalisation.
- Tests: targeted pytest selections covering the new validator and CLI cases plus full `uvx hatch test` -> 578 passed, 2 skipped (26.73s runtime; harness timeout at 33.9s immediately after pytest success).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #7)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree still carries in-flight provider/documentation harmonisation edits awaiting follow-up.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 571 passed, 2 skipped (18.53s runtime; command timed out at 25.6s immediately after pytest success).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #6)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree still carries in-flight provider/documentation harmonisation edits awaiting follow-up.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 567 passed, 2 skipped (17.24s runtime; harness completed without timeout).

### Enhanced - CLI Alias Resilience (2025-10-07)
- `validate_engine` now short-circuits canonical engine strings while accepting nested `uutel/<alias>/<model>` shorthands via a shared `_resolve_candidate` helper.
- `uutel list_engines` emits `uutel test --engine <alias>` hints for every primary alias derived from `examples.basic_usage.RECORDED_FIXTURES`, removing hard-coded test guidance.
- Added alias coverage invariant ensuring each canonical engine is reachable through either a CLI alias or model shorthand, alongside updated CLI tests locking gemini/cloud test hints.
- Tests: targeted selections (`tests/test_cli_validators.py::TestValidateEngine::test_validate_engine_accepts_nested_uutel_model_shorthand`, `tests/test_cli.py::TestUUTELCLI::test_list_engines_command`, `tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIDiagnostics`) plus full `uvx hatch test` -> 571 passed, 2 skipped (17.83s runtime).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #5)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md ahead of cleanup; worktree still carries in-progress provider/doc harmonisation edits staged for follow-up.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 564 passed, 2 skipped (17.22s runtime; harness completed without timeout).

### Enhanced - Engine Alias Normalisation (2025-10-07)
- Added `_normalise_engine_alias` to collapse underscores and whitespace before alias/model lookup, enabling inputs like `gemini_cli` and `gemini 2.5 pro`.
- Extended `validate_engine` to resolve `uutel/<model>` shorthands via `MODEL_NAME_LOOKUP`, covering `uutel/gpt-4o` and similar patterns.
- Tests: targeted alias regressions (`tests/test_cli_validators.py::TestValidateEngine::test_validate_engine_accepts_model_shorthand_alias` etc.) plus full `uvx hatch test` -> 567 passed, 2 skipped (19.17s runtime).

### Hardened - Gemini CLI Payload Guardrails (2025-10-07)
- Added regression tests covering CLI completion error payloads, content builder system-prompt folding, and mixed streaming JSON sanitisation.
- `_completion_via_cli` now invokes `_raise_if_cli_error` before parsing to surface rich `UUTELError` context for CLI failures.
- `_build_contents` folds system prompts into the first user part and skips tool/function blocks; streaming helpers now drop tool-call events while stripping ANSI control bytes.
- Tests: targeted Gemini CLI selections plus full `uvx hatch test` -> 564 passed, 2 skipped (19.91s runtime).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #4)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree continues to carry in-flight provider/doc updates awaiting upstream merge.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 559 passed, 2 skipped (19.86s runtime; harness reported completion without timeout).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #3)
### Gemini CLI Parameter Sanitisation (2025-10-07)
- Hardened Gemini CLI generation config via `_coerce_temperature`/`_coerce_max_tokens`, ensuring invalid optional params fall back to defaults across API and CLI paths.
- Normalised `_build_cli_command` to emit safe defaults and `_build_cli_prompt` to omit empty content, preventing 'None' leakage in prompts.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_gemini_provider.py::TestGenerationConfigDefaults`, `::TestGeminiCLICommandBuilder`, `::TestGeminiCLIPromptBuilder`, `uvx hatch test tests/test_gemini_provider.py` (31 passed), full `uvx hatch test` -> 555 passed, 2 skipped (20.07s; harness timeout at 25.3s).

- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree still carries staged provider and CLI changes pending completion.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 540 passed, 2 skipped (18.81s runtime; harness timeout at 24.3s immediately after pytest success).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle #2)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git status still shows in-flight provider and CLI changes pending review.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 537 passed, 2 skipped (18.69s runtime; command completed without harness timeout).

### Guidance Consistency Sprint (2025-10-07)
- Added CLI regression tests to snapshot provider requirements output and ensure usage examples include every `examples.basic_usage.RECORDED_FIXTURES` live hint.
- Updated README quick usage block to recorded live hints and enforced parity with a documentation lint test.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_documentation_aliases.py::test_readme_quick_usage_includes_recorded_hints`; `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli.py::TestUUTELCLI::test_list_engines_provider_requirements_cover_all_entries tests/test_cli.py::TestUUTELCLI::test_list_engines_usage_includes_recorded_live_hints`; `uvx hatch test` -> 540 passed, 2 skipped (19.29s runtime).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07 - report cycle)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree still carries prior in-progress changes (see `git status`).
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 531 passed, 2 skipped (17.73s runtime; command completed without harness timeout).

### Alias Synonym & Example Realism Sprint (2025-10-07)
- Extended CLI alias coverage with `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `cloud-code`, `codex-large`, and `openai-codex`, updated diagnostics to group synonyms per canonical engine, and refreshed recorded fixtures with curated transcripts that mirror current provider guidance.
- Added regression tests across `tests/test_cli_validators.py`, `tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIConfigCommands`, `tests/test_cli.py::TestCLIDiagnostics`, and `tests/test_examples.py` to guard alias resolution, config persistence, diagnostics output, and example snippets.
- Tests: targeted selections plus `uvx hatch test` -> 537 passed, 2 skipped (18.80s runtime).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-01 - report cycle)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; git worktree currently has outstanding changes but no TODO pruning was required.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 528 passed, 2 skipped (20.82s runtime; command completed without harness timeout).

### Terminal Output & Alias Guardrails (2025-10-01)
- `_scrub_control_sequences` now removes 8-bit CSI/OSC/DCS/APC/PM payloads and filters residual C1 bytes so CLI logs stay clean on tmux/screen.
- `_safe_output` accepts bytes-like payloads, decoding via UTF-8 with a latin-1 fallback before scrubbing so streamed subprocess output renders without artefacts.
- `_build_model_alias_map` raises on duplicate tail aliases (allowing the intentional `gemini-2.5-pro` overlap) to prevent silent overwrites when registering new providers.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli_helpers.py`, `uvx hatch test tests/test_cli_validators.py::TestValidateEngine::test_build_model_alias_map_raises_on_duplicate_tail`, `uvx hatch test` -> 531 passed, 2 skipped (18.98s runtime).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-01)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; ran `uvx hatch test` -> 521 passed, 2 skipped (28.06s runtime; command timed out at 34.5s immediately after pytest reported success).

### Engine Alias & Output Hygiene (2025-10-01)
- Extended `validate_engine` with bare-model lookup so inputs like `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4`, and `gemini-2.5-pro` resolve to canonical engines; added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_validators.py`.
- Hardened `_scrub_control_sequences` to stop truncating user output when OSC/DCS payloads omit their terminator, preserving trailing text while still stripping control bytes.
- Tightened `_safe_output` to raise on unknown targets, catching call-site typos before they silently redirect to stderr; added helper coverage for the new guard.
- Tests: targeted validator/helper suites plus `uvx hatch test` -> 528 passed, 2 skipped (22.20s runtime; harness timeout at 28.0s immediately after pytest success).

### Hardened - CLI Output Consistency (2025-10-07)
- `_scrub_control_sequences` now strips OSC/DCS/APC/PM payloads and preserves tabs/newlines, preventing tmux-style control strings leaking into CLI output.
- Added `_validate_engine_aliases()` so invalid alias targets raise at import, guarding CLI shortcuts against drift.
- `uutel list_engines` now emits engines and aliases in sorted order for deterministic help snapshots.
- Tests: targeted helpers/CLI selections plus `uvx hatch test` → 521 passed, 2 skipped (23.34s).

### QA - Regression Sweep (2025-10-07)
- /report: Reviewed PLAN.md and TODO.md; no stale tasks required pruning.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` -> 517 passed, 2 skipped (24.67s runtime) confirming suite health.

### Notes
- Codex CustomLLM now rejects whitespace-only and non-string model inputs with deterministic `BadRequestError` messaging and surfaces alias suggestions for mistyped model ids.
- Hardened Codex CustomLLM to resolve `codex-*` aliases, include provider/model metadata when raising LiteLLM errors, and align CLI error surfacing with litellm's BadRequest/APIConnection expectations.
- Ensured Codex CustomLLM gracefully bypasses LiteLLMException passthrough when the attribute is absent and covered streaming/model_response normalisation with dedicated regression tests.
- Normalised `uutel config set` coercion errors so invalid numeric/boolean input now reuse the shared bullet guidance and default sentinels clear stored overrides.
- Updated CLI help docstrings to surface alias-first guidance and adjusted Fire snapshot tests to consume stderr output.
- Refreshed README and provider docs to use `codex`/`claude` aliases exclusively and added a configuration snippet synced with `create_default_config()`.
- Hardened `uutel config` workflows by rejecting unknown keys and locking the default snippet + missing-file guidance behind regression tests.


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-30

### Changed - 2025-10-07

### Fixed - 2025-10-05
- Codex provider now recognises both legacy `tokens.*` and current top-level Codex CLI `auth.json` layouts, preventing false "missing access token" errors after running `codex login`.
- Gemini CLI streaming output buffers fragmented `{ "error": ... }` payloads and raises a single actionable `UUTELError` instructing users to refresh credentials when authentication fails mid-stream.
- Cloud Code readiness checks fall back to the gcloud default project configuration and surface an informational hint instead of hard-failing when `CLOUD_CODE_PROJECT` env vars are absent.

### Changed - 2025-10-06
- Gemini CLI completion now extracts the final JSON payload from stdout, tolerating banner/progress lines and ANSI escape codes while preserving structured usage data.
- Gemini CLI streaming parses JSONL `text-delta`/`finish` events into `GenericStreamingChunk`s, retaining raw-text fallback for legacy output and keeping error aggregation intact.
- Codex provider OpenAI API-key fallback now has regression coverage confirming request headers/payload honour sampling parameters and target `/chat/completions`.

### Added - 2025-10-04
- Introduced `uutel diagnostics` CLI command to summarise alias readiness and surface credential/tooling guidance before issuing live requests.
- Enhanced `examples/basic_usage.py` with `UUTEL_LIVE_EXAMPLE` / `UUTEL_LIVE_FIXTURES_DIR` toggles so the walkthrough can perform real provider calls or consume stubbed live fixtures.
- Expanded Codex error handling to map HTTP 403/429/5xx responses (including streaming paths) to actionable messages, honouring `Retry-After` hints and aligning troubleshooting guidance.

### Changed - 2025-10-03
- CLI verbose mode now toggles `LITELLM_LOG` instead of mutating `litellm.set_verbose`, eliminating deprecation warnings and gaining unit coverage.
- Codex async completion path now issues real async HTTP calls via httpx `AsyncClient`, preventing event-loop blocking and covered by new async unit test.
- Provider fixtures, tests, and documentation snippets updated to use recorded Codex sorting snippet rather than placeholder "mock response" phrasing.
- Added CLI provider readiness preflight guard so `uutel test` surfaces credential/CLI issues before hitting providers, with coverage for Codex and Claude scenarios.
- Reworked `examples/basic_usage.py` to replay recorded completions for Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Cloud Code, paired with a subprocess regression test to keep output stable.
- Extended Codex streaming handler to capture `response.function_call_name.delta` and `response.tool_call_arguments.delta` sequences, ensuring tool call metadata survives SSE replay.

### Changed - 2025-10-01
- CLI readiness checks now detect missing Cloud Code project IDs and OAuth/API-key credentials, surfacing guidance before issuing provider calls.
- Gemini CLI streaming adapter emits per-line `GenericStreamingChunk`s instead of collapsing output, improving downstream streaming UX.
- Codex provider translates HTTP 401 responses into actionable credential guidance for sync and async completions.

### Added - Real Provider Implementations (#201)
Replaced all mock provider implementations with real integrations:

#### 1. **Codex Provider** (ChatGPT CLI Integration)
- **Authentication**: Reads from `~/.codex/auth.json` (requires `codex login` CLI)
- **API Integration**: Connects to ChatGPT backend at `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`
- **Request Format**: Uses Codex-specific `input` field instead of OpenAI's `messages`
- **Headers**: Includes account-id, version, originator headers per Codex protocol
- **Fallback**: Falls back to OpenAI API when `api_key` is provided
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP error handling with user-friendly messages

#### 2. **Claude Code Provider** (Anthropic CLI Integration)
- **CLI Integration**: Executes `claude-code` CLI via subprocess
- **Authentication**: Uses Claude Code's built-in auth system
- **Installation**: Requires `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Models**: Supports sonnet, opus, claude-sonnet-4, claude-opus-4
- **Timeout**: 120-second timeout for CLI operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing CLI or auth failures

#### 3. **Gemini CLI Provider** (Google Gemini Integration)
- **Dual Mode**: API key or CLI-based authentication
- **API Mode**: Direct API calls to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
  - Uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` env vars
  - Proper Gemini API message format conversion
- **CLI Mode**: Falls back to `gemini` CLI tool
  - Requires `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- **Models**: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-pro, gemini-flash
- **Smart Fallback**: Tries API key first, then CLI if available

#### 4. **Cloud Code AI Provider** (Google OAuth Integration)
- **OAuth Support**: Reads credentials from `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`
- **API Key Support**: Also supports `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Multiple Credential Locations**: Checks `.gemini`, `.config/gemini`, `.google-cloud-code`
- **Same Models**: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-pro, gemini-flash
- **Usage Metadata**: Includes token usage information in responses
- **Endpoints**: Uses `/v1internal:generateContent` and streaming SSE to deliver real completions with tool + JSON schema support

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Reference Analysis**: Analyzed TypeScript/JavaScript reference implementations:
  - `codex-ai-provider` (Vercel AI SDK)
  - `ai-sdk-provider-gemini-cli` (Gemini CLI Core)
  - `cloud-code-ai-provider` (Google Cloud Code)
  - `ai-sdk-provider-claude-code` (Anthropic SDK)
- **Architecture Adaptation**: Converted Node.js patterns to Python/LiteLLM architecture
- **Authentication Flows**: Integrated with CLI authentication systems and OAuth
- **HTTP Client**: Uses `httpx` for reliable HTTP/2 connections
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages guiding users to authentication setup

### Authentication Setup Required

**Codex**: `codex login` (creates `~/.codex/auth.json`)
**Claude Code**: Install CLI + authenticate
**Gemini CLI**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or run `gemini login`
**Cloud Code**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or run `gemini login` (creates OAuth creds)

### Documentation & Examples (2025-10-01)
- CLI `list_engines` now surfaces provider-specific credential requirements.
- `examples/basic_usage.py` replays the deterministic Claude fixture and prints commands required for live CLAUDE runs.
- README examples section points to the fixture replay and enumerates the installation/login steps for enabling live Claude streaming.

### Enhanced - CLI Aliases & Recorded Examples (2025-10-02)
- Synced CLI engine listings/tests with alias shortcuts (`codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, `cloud`) and replaced pytest-asyncio usage in Codex delegation tests with `asyncio.run` wrappers to keep the suite plugin-free.
- Rebuilt `examples/basic_usage.py` around recorded completions for all providers and refreshed README guidance to highlight alias usage and live-run instructions.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` (235 passed) validating CLI updates, Codex delegation changes, and example output adjustments.

- ⚪ 2025-09-30: Added pytest xfail placeholders for Claude/Gemini/Cloud Code providers (`tests/test_provider_placeholders.py`) to track missing real integrations

### Fixed - Core Utility Surface (#202)
- Restored `RetryConfig`, HTTP client factory, tool schema validators/transformers, and tool call extraction helpers so the test suite and downstream imports match the planned API surface.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` *(fails: CLI + provider suites still rely on mock integrations hitting live endpoints)*, `uvx hatch test tests/test_utils.py tests/test_tool_calling.py` *(pass: 57 utility/tests)*

### Changed - Codex Completion Workflow (#202)
- Refactored `CodexUU` to build real OpenAI/Codex payloads, honour injected HTTP clients, normalise assistant content, and reuse shared retrying client infrastructure; updated tests to stub HTTP calls and validate request construction.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test tests/test_utils.py tests/test_tool_calling.py tests/test_codex_provider.py` *(pass: 71 utility + Codex tests)*; full `uvx hatch test` still fails on legacy CLI messaging expectations pending fixture refresh.

### Fixed - CLI Error Messaging Fixtures
- Updated CLI tests to expect contextual `format_error_message` output and refreshed engine listing assertions to match current UX copy.
- Tests: `uvx hatch test` *(pass: 199 tests)*.

### Documentation - Provider Authentication Prerequisites
- Added provider-specific installation and credential setup guidance to `README.md` (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cloud Code).
- Drafted the same guidance in `WORK.md` for traceability.
